As a scuba diver, I would like to be able to speed up the time it takes my dive master to sign off on my last dive.

As a dive master, It takes way to long to sign off on dives, I would love to have an easier and digitalized way to sign off on diverâ€™s previous dives.

As a software developer and scuba diver, bringing scuba diving and software will create a more efficient way of logging and signing off on dives.

As a software developer, I want to help digitalize and make anything more efficient and this a great way of helping divers and dive masters digitalize log books.
