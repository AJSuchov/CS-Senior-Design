Project Background:
Scuba Divers, once done with their dives, will record their dives in log books. The Divers then take the log book and get the dives that were conducted signed off by a Dive Master or a Dive Store at the location to verify that the dives had been conducted. Aaron is a certified diver and this past summer ran accross a Dive Master that said he wished there was an easier way to sign for peoples dive logs. He said it would be great if people could just go and scan something that will give them a signature. This project aims to do just that and digitalize that process for both the log book and getting a signature for the log book.

Project Problem Statement:
We are going to create a system that will make the process of getting signatures for dive log books more efficient and making it with times by having a mobile app that can get a digital signature from a Dive Master for the log book. This will also be a cheaper alternative for people as most applications for log books require purchasing.  

Inadequacy of Current Solutions:
Right now there is no solution to the current signature problem. All log book apps require to be physically signed on the divers phone by the dive master thus resulting in some bad looking signatures or will allow for anyone to sign.     

Background skills:
*Both of us have taken a class on database design.
*Both of us have experience creating apps that use a databases due to our project in our Software Engineering course. 
*Both of us have Web developement skills incase we decide to have a website as well.

Approaches to the problem and goals:
Our solution and goal is to create an app that will get the digital signature from the dive master as well as be a modern app. Our plan for the digital signature is to use a bar code system so that will have the information of the dive master and can be accessed by either phone or printed to paper that a diver can scan for more convienence. We will also be using a database that the Dive Master register with for the signature. The bar code will also include allowing for signature to be put onto multiple logs at once to allow for more convienence.
